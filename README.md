### CPSC 120

* Lab 10

  Lab 10, part 2 was interesting to complete because it used
  lots of different topics that we learned throughout other labs
  and lectures. I liked creating the logic used to help get the
  population for different counties in California. I would like to
  use this type of logic to help with other projects with figuring
  out distances of counties and maybe calculating the distance and having
  a 2d vector to store the distances from one county to another.

* Lab 09

  Lab 9, part 1, was great to complete. It may be a simple judge
  calculator, but it was useful to understand more about for/each
  loop and if/else logic. It is great to get command line arguments
  and use them straight to get the score. If I want to use other things
  I have learned I would like to have a file that has multiple lines for
  multiple scores and output it to another file with the average for each
  score.

* Lab 08

  Lab 8, part 1. It was a simple program that took command-line arguments
  and used it to add it to a string data type for protein, bread, and condiments
  for making a sandwich. In the future, I would like to use vectors or a set,
  to add different proteins, bread, and condiments so that the logic can be
  corrected as in the file, you can put the protein in different orders in the
  command line and it will output incorrectly, so by having different vectors that
  have preset proteins like beef or chicken will allow for correct logic.
